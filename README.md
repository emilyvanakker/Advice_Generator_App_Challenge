## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Click on the dice button to generate a new piece of advice

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I would like to continue working on the user experience for this project. As the ajax call is happening I would add a loading animation to the button to indicate to users that 
it is not clickable at that time. 

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

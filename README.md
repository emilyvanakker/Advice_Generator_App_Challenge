## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Click on the dice button to generate a new piece of advice

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

For continued development I would add a loading animation to the button while the ajax call is happening to improve the UX.
